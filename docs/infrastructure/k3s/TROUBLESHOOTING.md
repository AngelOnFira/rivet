# Troubleshooting

## Check what ports are forwarded to my load balancer?

Check the ports forwarded with this command:

```
docker ps | grep k3d
```

## I'm getting `Empty reply from server`

This means Traefik hasn't started yet. Make sure the deployment works.

## Pods stuck in `Pending`

Run `kubectl describe` on the pod. Your machine likely ran out of storage or memory.

Once you have cleaned up disk space, run `kubectl describe nodes` to see if the node show the error still there. You may have to run `k3d cluster stop <cluster name> && k3d cluster start <cluster name>` to restart the cluster.

If you see `Unschedulable: true`, fix it by running: `kubectl uncordon <node name>`
