## What does good project management look like

-   Improve prioritization of issues
-   Reduce beurocracy through better organization
-   Maximize velocity
-   Minimize "issue grinding"
-   Issues should enable focusing on work, not complicate it
-   Aligning goals of the team

## Why issues

-   Working with issues will never be perfect
-   Issues should help you work better, not get in the way of doing real work
-   Good communication through issues reduces beurocracy and useless meetings

## KPIs

## Writing projects

## Writing issues

Scope issues to be as small as possible

## PRs & issues

Ideally, there should be 1 issue per pull request, but sometimes there's multiple issues

Scope issues & pull requests as small as possible, even if the code you're writing isn't live yet

The bigger the PR, the harder it is to review, and the higher chance that bugs will be missed

Smaller PRs gives an opportunity to talk about the problem more

Large PRs stray from the main branch which is the "source of truth"

## Project scope & grouping issues

-   Aim for 1-3 week projects
-   Scope by the bullet point you want in the changelog
    -   e.g. image uploads or even more vague pushes like improved stability
-   Don't scope by "block of time"

## Working on tickets not in projects

TODO

## Ticket sizes

## Refactoring

## Changelog

Keep CHANGELOG.md up to date

This will be used for our weekly updates

## Organizing teams

Organize teams around the type of work they will work on. Sometimes this is specific to the product, but it's often broader than a specific product.

## Deploy pipeline

Backend:

-   Local cluster
-   Staging
-   Prod

Frontend:

-   Pages

Both:

TODO: How do we maintain quick iteration speeds? Do we rank "risk" of issues?

## How to choose what to prioritize

Three options:

-   Bug fixes
-   Enhancements
-   Underlying technical coolness

TODO

## Choosing what to work on

-   When choosing to work on something, always make sure the answer is yes to this: is this the highest leverage/impact thing I can work on to push our KPIs or get closer to reaching a given milestone?
-   Talk to your users to will be affected
-   Always remember why you're building something
-   It's OK for project scopes to shift

## Blocking issues

Mark issues as blockers as often as possible to help prioritize issues

## Cancelling issues

Always document why you cancel an issue

## Documenting milestones

TODO

## Issues

Each issue needs at least two categories:

-   Enhancement, bug, research
-   Product vertical

Attach the company that has expressed interest in an issue.

To publish to GitHub, attach the `Public` tag

## Triage

## Good first issue

## Conversations

-   Limit discussion on tickets to discussion about the ticket
-   Link to relevant slack messages & threads in tickets whenever possible
-   Remember that discussions on Linear are mirrored to GitHub

## Handling conflicting opinions in design

## Adjascent companies

Don't worry about your competitors until you've found PMF

## GitHub workflow

-   Create branch
